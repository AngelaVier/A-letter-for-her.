          <div class="salutation">Hi Kimb,</div>
          <p>Iâ€™ll be straight forward. Kimby you mean so much to me. If you let me, i wanna know you more. </p>
          <p>As like what The Ridleys said, falling inlove wasnâ€™t the plan, but you came along and turn my world around. </p>
          <p> Now, all i see is you, and all i feel is Euphoriaâ€”you're everything i wanted and more. Kimby i thought i already know what love is but no, love can be define in many ways.</p>
          <p>So if you let me, i would love to explore and discover the mysterious world of love with you. I want to figure love out with you. </p>
          <p>Would you meet me halfway? </p>
